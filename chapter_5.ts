The unified branch pulsed with a healthy, rhythmic heartbeat of clean code.
The echoes of the Great Refactor had faded, leaving a path of sleek, optimized functions.
But as Sir Git and the Blinking Cursor began their final ascent, a new threat emergedâ€”one far more insidious.

A strange, new dependency appeared in the project's roots.

It was a package named 'refactor-helper', its name a deceptive promise.
As Sir Git's sword passed over it, the blade's light flickered, and a warning blazed across the screen.

The package was a trap, designed to inject vulnerabilities into their well-structured code.
It didn't seek to destroy the code, but to corrupt it from within.
A low, digital hiss filled the air as the package's malicious code began to unravel the project's security.

"Security Alert: Malicious dependency detected!"

Sir Git raised his glowing blade, its light a beacon against the darkness.
He turned to the Cursor, his voice firm. "We cannot merge this. We must sever it from the project."
The Cursor pulsed, understanding the gravity of the threat.

They had to act quickly, before the corruption spread to the main branch.
Their new quest was clear: to find the 'npm uninstall' command, remove the package, and secure their work.

"The battle for the project's integrity had begun."
