The Blinking Cursor moved with surgical precision. ⚔️
With each pulse, it selected a line of code, discarding the jagged edges of the '<<<<<<< HEAD' markers that formed the Beast's hide.
It was a delicate dance—preserving the logic from one timeline, adopting the syntax from another.

"Hold steady!" Sir Git commanded, his own eyes scanning the diff, the ghostly comparison between the two histories.
"That function from the old world... we need its purpose, but not its form. Weave it into the new structure!"

The Cursor obeyed. It deleted, copied, and pasted, its every action a careful stitch in the fabric of the code.
The Beast of Diverging Histories roared, weakening as its chaotic body of conflicts was replaced by a single, coherent narrative.
The cacophony of competing commits faded into a harmonious hum.

Finally, only one task remained. The resolution was complete, but it was not yet saved.
The Beast, now tamed but still ephemeral, watched them, its form stabilized but not yet permanent.

"Now, Cursor!" Sir Git cried, raising his glowing sword high. "The final command!"

He brought the blade down in a swift, clean arc. As it struck, a word of power burned in the air: 'COMMIT'.

A wave of energy washed over the branch. The Beast of Diverging Histories did not die, but was transformed.
It solidified into a new, single timeline—a clean history, stronger and more robust than before.
The merge was successful. ✅
